        There has been an internal re-shuffle in order to isolate the parts of the
        system that hold a firewall handle to one unprivileged process, with the main
        connection handling process & grey processes communicating with it over a pipe.
        Now the main connection handling process has no privileges, and runs chrooted
        with no direct access to the database (may run as a different user) nor the
        firewall.
